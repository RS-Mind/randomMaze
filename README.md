# randomMaze
Renders a randomized maze that a player can navigate in the console

Upon startup, requests a scale (maze generates with a square of cells with side length equalling scale), an entrance point (can be randomized), and an exit point (can be randomized).

Maze is navigated by inputting cardinal directions {North, East, South, West}. Program ends when the player (represented by @) reaches the exit (represented by !!!).
